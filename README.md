# MyMovieList

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Description

MyMovieList is a web application that provides detailed information about movies and TV shows. It features trailers, images, and recommendations based on the selected movie or TV show. The application aims to offer users a comprehensive and engaging experience by presenting up-to-date and relevant content.

## Features
- Search Movies or TV Shows
- List of Movies or TV Shows
- Detailed Information
- User Authentication
- Responsive Layouts and UI Design

## Getting Started

### Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-movie-list.git
cd my-movie-list
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### Running the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Assumptions and Limitations

- The application assumes that users have a stable internet connection to fetch movie details.
- The current implementation does not support user activities, such as reviews, favorites, and watchlist.
